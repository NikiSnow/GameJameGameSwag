## Working with the Project

### Best Practices
1. **Scene Management**:
   - Always create a new scene when working on new features
   - Save scenes in the appropriate folder (Scenes/Characters, Scenes/UI, etc.)

2. **Asset Ownership**:
   - Do not modify scripts you didn't create without consulting the author
   - Avoid changing scenes or prefabs that aren't yours
   - If you need changes to someone else's work, communicate with them first
